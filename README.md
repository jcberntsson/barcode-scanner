# bAR
Barcode enabled Augumented Reality.

## What
bAR scans the enviroment using the camera and will display information of the products it encounters. The information is compiled into four major sections: environment, social impacts, pricing, and nutrional value. 

## Why
During shopping there is not enough time to compare the products in a meaningful way, and information such as enviromental and social impacts is not often included. This is where bAR fits in, while running through the shop it is easy to just point your phone towards the products and get a snapshot of the most important information needed to choose the right product. 

## Why "augumented"?
Common barcode scanners usually scans the environment and then switch view to display the information, which takes too much time. This is why bAR use augumented reality to more efficiently display the information. 

## Pitch
The point of bAR is to streamline the shopping experience, with an easy and fast barcode scanner. The product information is compiled into four sections: environmental impact, social impact, nutrional value, and pricing. The details are displayed in an inline graphical interface creating an augumented reality experience, which enables the user to scan multiple products in a fast sequence for comparison.
